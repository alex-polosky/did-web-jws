DID format:
did:example:123456789abcdefghi
[scheme]:[DID method]:[DID method-specific id]


example DID:
{
    "@context":
    [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"

DID abnf syntax rules:
did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
method-name        = 1*method-char
method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
method-specific-id = *( *idchar ":" ) 1*idchar
idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_" / pct-encoded
pct-encoded        = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
did-url = did path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]


Common DID parameters available for all DID methods; optional:
service         Identifies a service from the DID document by service ID. If present, the associated value MUST be an ASCII string. 
relativeRef     Relative URI reference that identifies a resource at a service endpoint, which is selected from a DID doc through `service`. MUST be an ASCII string and use percent-encoding for certain characters.
versionId       Identifies a specific version of a DID document to be resolved. MUST be an ASCII string.
versionTime     Identifies a certain version timestamp of a DID document to be resolved. MUST be an ASCII string, valid XML datetime value, normalized to UTC, no sub-second precision.
hl              Resource hash of the DID doc to add integrity protection; non-normative; MUST be an ASCII string.


example DID utilizing relative refs:
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
